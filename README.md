Key Difference between two months: June & December 
* The average (mean) temperature of June is 3 degress higher than December
* The maximum temperature of June is 2 degrees higher than December
* The miniimum temperature of June is 8 degress higher than December
* According to the histogram of two months, the frequency of 75 degress is significantly more frequent in June comparing to December. 

## Summary 
Although the temperature is much lower during December, running both an ice cream business and surfing shop doesn't seem to look hard even during December. The June is one of the hottest month in Hawaii but Hawaii also has a nice weather in December. By looking at the statistical analysis of both months - June and December - weather and temperature is not a big obstacle to run the business.
